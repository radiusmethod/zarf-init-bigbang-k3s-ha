# zarf-init-bigbang-k3s-ha

> ⚠️This has a custom k3s package that allows for deploying in an HA configuration.  This repository is implementing what could be merged into the upstream Zarf repository [here](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/pull/2495),

This package uses Iron Bank images for as many things as possible.  This package also assumes you will use a logging stack from within Big Bang.

Build locally:

```shell
make build
```
